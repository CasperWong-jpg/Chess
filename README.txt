Project Description

Name: Chess!
Description: This project will involve making a fully functional version of the board game chess, checking for and enforcing rules such as castling, pawn promotion, and checkmate. The game can be played by two people on the same computer, and also by one person against an AI. Users may also play another chess variant called Crazyhouse, where users can place any piece that they capture on the board as their own!
